# commons-health
 
This is a small *Django* app implementing a *mini-site* for an internal research project of *Sapienza - Universit√† di Roma* (uniroma1.it).
It intends to be also an example of how to superimpose the aspect of a dedicated virtual site to one of the many *communities* being hosted by *CommonSpaces*, the (currently) unique deployment of the *CommonS Platform* (see the project https://github.com/gtoffoli/commons).
